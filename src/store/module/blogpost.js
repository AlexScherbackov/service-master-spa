			title: 'Top Tips for Preventing Basement Seepage',

			text: 'Even though it may not feel like it to a homeowner experiencing water damage in the lower level of their home, leaking basements are common occurrences in homes throughout the country. After all, any type of foundation can spring a leak, especially as the weather continues to worsen throughout this holiday season.',
			html: ` 
				<p class="blogpost__article">Leaky basements experience something called basement seepage, which is when water finds ways to enter your basement and pool on your floor, causing it to flood and damage your property.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">What causes it? Essentially, water or moisture in basements come from two major sources: indoor humidity that condenses on cold surfaces or water that comes from outside. Rainwater, melting snow or groundwater can saturate the soil around your foundation and leak into your home. Water can leak through cracks or it can even penetrate basement walls in the form of water vapor.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">How do you fix it? Though several solutions are available to reduce the amount of water that enters your basement, there is no foolproof answer to resolve the problem.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article"><strong>STEP ONE</strong></p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">The first thing you should do once you notice basement seepage is to check the walls where the water is entering. Try to determine if the water is entering along a single wall entirely underground, along multiple walls or on one side of the house only.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">To figure out what’s causing the problem, tape aluminum foil to your basement wall and inspect it a few days later. Moisture on the outside surface of the foil indicates high indoor humidity. Moisture behind the foil means moisture is leaking through the walls.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article"><strong>STEP TWO</strong></p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">Once you determine the source of the water, start looking for cracks in the affected area. Apply an epoxy during the months when the walls remain dry to seal up cracks. Make sure you squeeze the epoxy well into the walls to make sure that a tight bond is created.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article"><strong>STEP THREE</strong></p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">Start working to remove excess humidity from the area. This will help you dry out your basement. Seal leaky dryer vents with foil tape to prevent unwanted humid air from entering your basement. After doing this you can remove any excess water that has started to pool on your floors.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">You can also add a vent fan to your basement bathroom and make sure your family turns it on during showers. Keep your basement windows closed during humid weather. And if you’re still getting condensation on cool surfaces, you can run a dehumidifier to lower the indoor humidity.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">How do you prevent this from happening in the first place? Make sure that any damaged gutters are repaired or replaced to ensure that no more water enters your basement. Gutters are generally the cause of basement seepage since they are prone to drainage issues. You can place cement splash pads along the gutter in order to carry water away from your house foundations.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">Another way you can continue to prevent water from entering your basement is by creating a slope away from the outside foundation of your home. Add dirt next to the outside basement wall so that it slopes down two inches for every foot. This will help from water pooling around your home.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">You should also apply a layer of waterproofing on the inside of your basement walls. Make sure you spray the waterproofing in an even application. Hold the spray at least 10 inches away from the basement walls and spray from side-to-side until the wall is covered. Spray one wall at a time. Allow it to dry completely for two to three days before spraying another wall to ensure the proper application.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">Finally, it’s important to note that condensation dripping from cold pipes can also contribute to basement water problems. Cover cold water pipes with foam pipe insulation to stop condensation.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">You can also hire the professionals from our ServiceMaster family to inject an external waterproofing solution around the surface of your foundation if you are at a loss and would rather have the problem resolved quickly and without doing any dirty work! This waterproofing will seal up areas underground that normally allow water to seep into your basement.</p>

			title: '3 Ways the Cold Affects Your Home',
			date: new Date(2019, 0, 29),
			theme: 7,
			poster: './src/assets/image/blogposts/blog-3.jpg',
			text: 'So far, 2017 is cold. The new year has brought unusual, life-threatening freezing temperatures. And with pre-wind chill temperatures dropping well below zero this week, it’s important to keep in mind what kind of negative effects frigid weather can have on homes and buildings. ',
			html: ` 
				<p class="blogpost__article">While here at ServiceMaster Restoration by Simons, we believe life safety should always be the number one concern, bracing your home for the cold is a close second. Here are just three ways the cold can damage your home this winter:</p>
				<ul class="blogpost__list" >
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">
						<span class="blogpost__list-title">Stagnant and moisture-filled air</span>
						<p class="blogpost__article">When the temperature drops outside, the first thing people do is start closing up their homes. Windows and doors are shut and locked, and sometimes weatherproofing products are used to ensure they remain sealed. While this does a good job of keeping air and heat inside the home to combat the cold outside, it can be quite harmful to the home’s interior — and for human health. When a home is “closed up” for winter, the air inside is effectively stagnated. This traps moisture inside (which can cause mold and infrastructure rotting), which is especially troubling when there are multiple occupants creating extra moisture by breathing, bathing, cooking and exercising. In addition, stagnant air contains stagnant odors and traps harmful particles like germs, microbes and dust mites. To compensate for stagnated air, it’s important to create air movement in the winter months using ceiling or floor fans.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">
						<span class="blogpost__list-title">Dried-out interior</span>
						<p class="blogpost__article">The next thing people do in extreme cold temperatures is turn on their home’s heating system. This has the tendency to dry the interior out, and in doing so can encourage expansion and contraction of interior materials and cause cracks in drywall, doors that don’t fit, separating wood trim, heaved floors, and other problems. Basements and older homes are especially vulnerable to this. Many homeowners might have furnace humidifiers, which were designed to counteract the dry conditions created by the heating system. However, be careful about how high these are set since they can add to and make worse the moisture problem already created by stagnant air.</p>
					</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">
						<span class="blogpost__list-title">Frozen pipes</span>
						<p class="blogpost__article">In extremely cold exterior temperatures, outdoor and indoor pipes can freeze, especially when they are surrounded by little or no insulation. Most exposed pipes in the average home are not insulated, which makes pipe freezing a real and common issue for homeowners in a place like Chicago that regularly sees freezing temperatures in the winter. When temperatures drop below 32 degrees Fahrenheit, most homeowners are at great risk for frozen pipes. If the water in a pipe freezes, it will expand and obstruct water flow to the tap. Sometimes, the water will expand so much the pipe can no longer support its pressure. That’s when homeowners experience pipe bursting, which can be a costly and damaging emergency situation. We recommend installing pipe insulation (which isn’t very expensive or time-consuming) to avoid a serious emergency this winter.</p>

			date: new Date(2019, 1, 11),

			text: 'Man, has it been cold outside recently. With temperatures dropping well below zero in the past few weeks, residents in the Chicagoland area are facing major threats to home safety with frozen and burst pipes. When temperatures fall below zero degrees, pipes are incredibly vulnerable and cause incredible home damage. Since they can quickly turn into a very expensive problem for homeowners, the professionals at ServiceMaster Restoration by Simons have created this guide to give you a crash course in Pipe Freezing 101. Read on to learn how to prevent pipes from freezing, how to thaw pipes if they do freeze, and what to do if frozen pipes end up bursting and causing vast water damage to your home.',
			html: ` 
				<h2 class="blogpost__title">How to Prevent Pipes from Freezing</h2>
				<p class="blogpost__article">While you might think that Chicago homes would be built to withstand the cold, many do a poor job surviving the winter without significant damage. Within homes, there are areas where pipes are more likely to incur damage due to freezing temperatures. Some of these places include:</p>
				<ul class="blogpost__list" >
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Outdoor areas (hose bibs, water lines to irrigation systems, wells or pools)</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Unheated areas (garage, attic, crawl space or basement)</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Cabinets, where pipes cannot get enough heat when cabinet doors are closed (under the kitchen or bathroom sink)</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Uninsulated exterior walls</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="blogpost__article">Once you’ve determined what pipes may be susceptible to freezing, you will want to take action to protect those pipes when temperatures plummet:</p>
				<ul class="blogpost__list" >
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Open cabinets. This allows the warm air to circulate around pipes.</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">If there are pipes in the attic, open the door to allow warm air to move upwards</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Let water trickle from faucets. The constantly flowing water will prevent pipes from freezing. The small amount of water you waste is much less than the cost of a plumbing repair or the amount of water that will escape if a pipe bursts.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="blogpost__article">These tips may get you through a handful of cold nights, but in general, we recommend preemptively insulating pipes during your home winterizing process.</p>
				<h2 class="blogpost__title">How to Insulate Pipes</h2>
				<p class="blogpost__article">Insulating pipes is by far the best way to prevent pipes from freezing. Here’s how:</p>
				<ul class="blogpost__list" >
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Tubular sleeve insulation</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Fiberglass insulation</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Duct tape</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Foil insulation tape</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Heating blanket tape</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">In a pinch, use newspaper and duct tape</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="blogpost__article">Prepare the pipes. A simple wipe down with soapy water will do the trick. Wrap the pipes with the material you’ve chosen. Be sure to cover all exposed surfaces. Secure the edges and corners with duct tape. If you use fiberglass insulation, wrap the insulation with sheets of plastic or duct tape as well.</p>

			title: 'Your Number One Guide to Oven Safety',
			date: new Date(2019, 1, 21),
			theme: 5,
			poster: './src/assets/image/blogposts/blog-1.jpg',
			text: 'Some of the most dangerous items in your house are the very ones that you would least suspect — like your oven! Even though you might use your oven and stove regularly, without the proper precautions and maintenance this kitchen appliance can quickly become dangerous. Oven incidents can cause kitchen fires, which lead to smoke and soot…and the need for kitchen restoration after the fact.',
			html: ` 
				<p class="blogpost__article">Too many times, families see kitchen safety as reactionary — that is, they wait until after an incident has occured to focus on clearing and restoring the smoke and fire damage. Instead, we challenge you to be proactive in your approach to kitchen safety and especially oven safety. Here are our top tips to help mitigate risks associated with your kitchen’s oven:</p>
				<ul class="blogpost__list" >
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Keep your stove and oven clean: Grease and debris from cooking can ignite, causing fires. Wipe your stove top down frequently, and run the self-cleaning function on your oven often. If your oven does not have a self cleaning function, make sure to manually clean it after each use to make sure nothing remains inside that could cause a fire.</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Put in the extra effort: Make sure your stove and oven hood are safely and correctly installed.</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Protect yourself: Tie back long hair and tuck in loose clothing. Wear non-slip footwear. Make sure to use protective hot mitts when moving pots and pans. Take extra care not to splash hot oil; using a splatter guard may help.</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Purchase a fire extinguisher and keep it near your cooking area: Smother any fires with a tight lid or use the fire extinguisher you have nearby. This could help reduce your need for professional smoke, soot and fire cleanup. </li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Watch out for loose items: Do not let loose items like towels lay on or near your oven. These can quickly ignite and cause a fire. Keep the area around your oven clean and do not let clutter build up. Clutter could cause a fire to spread to other parts of the kitchen.</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Storage: Do not use your oven for storage!</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Children and pets: Use baby gates to keep very young children and pets out of the kitchen so they don’t put anything in your oven when you are not looking. Also, ensure they cannot touch or access the oven while it is in use.</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Don’t throw out your anti-tip bracket. Instead, install it: It keeps the stove in place, which is particularly good if you have small kids around who might try to use the opened oven door as a step</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Don’t line your oven with aluminum foil: Lining the bottom of your oven with aluminum foil may seem like a good way to catch drippings, but the foil can block air flow or trap heat. This might cause fires, carbon monoxide buildup, or general damage to the appliance. Using a piece of foil on your racks to catch grease is also a bad idea, as the grease can pool in the foil and eventually cause spillage. Use a real pan to catch grease instead.</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Know when to call for help: In the event of a fire, be sure to call 911 to help you extinguish the mess and keep your kitchen safe. After your home is secure, call our crews at ServiceMaster Restoration By Simons to clean up smoke and soot while restoring fire damage. Our professionals will bring your kitchen back to order and help get your family’s life back on track</li>

			text: 'If you’re planning a residential or commercial construction project and you’re not already thinking about a plan for clean up afterwards, you should be. The professionals at ServiceMaster Restoration by Simons have decades of experience in cleaning up after construction projects. You’d be surprised how often we find that customers have forgotten to budget for or schedule a post-construction cleaning until the very last minute.',
			html: ` 
				<p class="blogpost__article">The problem is, customers don’t realize that post-construction cleaning is an important part of any building project. They don’t understand that post-construction cleanups are some of the most important projects a restoration company will take on. These kinds of jobs usually require a company’s entire crew to be onsite for anywhere between a few days to a whole week depending on whether it is a residential or commercial project.</p>
				<p class="blogpost__article">We like to make sure that customers understand the level of care and commitment that goes into each of our post-construction cleanup projects. The professionals at ServiceMaster Restoration by Simons are well-trained in providing unrivaled and thorough post-construction cleaning. We use products and equipment that meet the highest standards to remove all dust and debris properly. Some of the post-construction cleanup services we offer the Chicagoland area include:</p>
				<ul class="blogpost__list" >
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Dusting air diffusers</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Cleaning light fixtures within construction area</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Cleaning restroom fixtures</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Wall washing or spot cleaning walls</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Ceiling washing</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Cleaning interior windows</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">HEPA Vacuuming</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Cleaning carpet areas</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Damp mopping hard-surface floors</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Renewing hard wood floors</li>
					<li class="blogpost__list-item">Roto buffing ceramic tile or linoleum</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="blogpost__article">Our process is one that maximizes efficiency while still delivering the highest level of service. Ideally, our process begins well before the construction project occurs — when a customer reaches out proactively for a quote. No worries if you’re one of the many who let post-construction fall by the wayside during the planning stages; if we can accommodate your dates, we will absolutely still offer quotes to contractors and homeowners who reach out during the construction project. After our free quote is approved and we are hired for a post-construction cleanup, we begin to formulate a scope based on the job’s specific needs and we gather up the necessary personnel and equipment.</p>
